# AI Safety Curriculum

This website is a work-in-progress to build a "textbook" for a complete course on AI safety.
It's meant for prospective researchers, engineers, a general public, and people working on policy.

It's partially inspired by [Distill](https://distill.pub) and the [Distill web framework](https://github.com/distillpub/template).
