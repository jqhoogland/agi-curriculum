The aim of the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines that can acquire, understand, and use knowledge as humans can. It's not about faking intelligence or about achieving intelligence in a few narrow domains (like board games and image recognition) or even about building tools that assist (but do not replace) humans. It's about building machines that can do anything that a human can do, and when possible, do it better.

> The incentives for further development of AI [...] are huge, and the momentum appears unstoppable. We must, therefore, ask, “What if we succeed?” This question is seldom considered in the AI literature, which is focused primarily on the pursuit of success rather than on its consequences. Alan Turing, widely regarded as the founder of computer science, did consider the question. And in 1951, during a lecture given to a learned society in Manchester, he answered: "It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. . . . At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control." [@russell2022]

:def[the alignment problem]
This is a book about the consequences. It's about the risks of building machines that are "smarter" than we are. It's about our still very limited understanding of how we can reduce those risks. It's about the central problem of artificial intelligence once it succeeds: **the alignment problem**, the problem of making sure that the machines we build and deploy pursue our goals and not their own.
