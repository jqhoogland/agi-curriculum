## A Note On Pre-Paradigmatic Science

In 1962, philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn published his seminal work *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*. In it, Kuhn argued that science is not a linear and continuous process of accumulating knowledge but a series of discrete "paradigm shifts."

    Kuhn's theory is reminiscent of Eldredge and Gould's punctuated equilibrium theory of evolution. Rather than evolution being a gradual process, it consists of long periods of stasis, punctuated by sudden bursts of change.

As such, AI safety is incredibly broad. Researchers come from a variety of backgrounds and draw on a variety of disciplines â€” from logic to probability theory, from economics to psychology, from neuroscience to contemporary machine learning.  It's likely many of the current approaches will not pan out. But it's difficult to anticipate which, so in the interest of increasing our odds of success, we've chosen to err on the side of including too much.

## The Outline

This book is organized into two parts:

1. Foundations
2. Central Problems in AI Safety
